Scripts for keeping Available status in MS Teams
### Ways to keep status available in ms Teams

1. PowerShell
2. Python
3. JavaScript

Also:
_Just start an instant meeting with myself in MS Teams. It will then automatically change your status to “in a meeting” (with the red icon), but then I manually change it to “available” (green icon). It stays that way the rest of the time that I have the meeting up._
